	open an issue with your changes

1.027 2021-10-11T14:15:02Z
	* Add whoami, originally from OÄŸuz Ersen. Let me know if you find 
	problems with this.
	* Fix a problem with the - special filename in bc, from Michael Mikonos
	* Various improvements to make date work better on Windows (but still
	a long way to go)

	* A fix for `grep -v` from Ed Avis (#69)

1.022 2021-01-11T06:59:31Z
	* Remove the make program and its dependencies, which recently 
	became much heavier. Strawberry Perl comes with gmake and it's
	to find make tools for Windows.

	* Remove a bit of fluff sticking around after taking out bin/man
	* Completed the move from Travis CI to Github Actions
	* The uudecode tool now has tests, and with the -o option can
	send its output somewhere else, including stdout
	* Many programs have converted to three argument open calls, but
	many don't have tests beyond compilation. Let me know what breaks.

	* Most uses of indirect object notation are gone
	https://github.com/briandfoy/PerlPowerTools/issues/73 (thanks

1.020 2020-09-15T17:09:32Z
	* Better Windows tests for rot13
	* Exclude bin/man, which is old Perl4 code that needs a lot of work

1.019_03 2020-09-13T16:03:58Z
	* work harder to test rot13 on Windows

1.019_02 2020-08-10T16:43:59Z
	* Fixing up the rot13 test

1.019_01 2020-08-08T21:07:03Z

	* Several test fixes by mohawk2 (#86)

1.017 2020-02-16T00:27:01Z

	utilities or features.

1.016 2019-09-13T13:37:01Z
	* Try very hard to make the find.t test work now that find2perl
	does not come with perl. Look in many places for it and skip
	tests if you can't find it.

1.015 2019-07-22T01:34:34Z
	* test bin/cat

1.014 2019-07-22T01:25:36Z

	* Add tests for the sort program (Shlomi Fish)
	* Add -amin, -cmin and -mmin to `find` command (timgimyee)

1.012_01 2017-01-14T03:50:20Z
	* Adjust prereq version to Test::Trap to not use leading v,
	which I think is confusing some installers.
	* Ideally, Test::Trap will disappear so we don't have the
	dependency: https://github.com/briandfoy/PerlPowerTools/issues/49

1.012 2017-01-11T13:07:08Z

	* A Makefile.PL fix for v5.8

1.011_01 2016-08-31T14:25:21Z
	* Escape { in regexes in dc and glob. Perl v5.26 will demand this.

1.011 2016-08-30T16:52:26Z

	isn't core.

1.007_01 2016-03-07T19:05:46Z

	triggered
	* Skip -x tests on Windows.

	* Add docs about the default install location to the
	README and module docs.
	* Fix the diff docs (GitHub #20)

1.005 2015-04-17T01:20:12Z
	* Don't install at the same location as perl. Make the
	user think about where to install them so these tools
	don't interfere with the real tools of the same name.

1.004 - 2014-12-20
	* Try to get first come permissions on ppt so I can close those
	tickets (and release something to replace ppt)

	the programs

1.02 - 2014-09-12
	* Trim the distribution, drastically. Let MetaCPAN be the website.

1.01 - 2014-09-12
	* Let's update Perl Power Tools and make it easier to find - call
	it PerlPowerTools instead of ppt
	* I'm not sure all of the programs even ran, but at least they
	compile now
	* I've probably broken some things, but now I want to see what's
	unauthorized.
