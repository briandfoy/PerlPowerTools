Revision history for Perl module PerlPowerTools

1.019_02 2020-08-10T16:43:59Z
	* Fixing up the rot13 test

1.019_01 2020-08-08T21:07:03Z
	* Added rot13 from @marked (#83)
	* Several test fixes by mohawk2 (#86)

1.017 2020-02-16T00:27:01Z
	* Convert to three-argument open in a bunch of places. No new
	utilities or features.

1.016 2019-09-13T13:37:01Z
	* Try very hard to make the find.t test work now that find2perl
	does not come with perl. Look in many places for it and skip
	tests if you can't find it.

1.015 2019-07-22T01:34:34Z
	* test bin/cat

1.014 2019-07-22T01:25:36Z
	* Fix the test for bin/find to use the perl that's running the test

1.013 2018-11-17T14:32:26Z
	* Add tests for the sort program (Shlomi Fish)
	* Add -amin, -cmin and -mmin to `find` command (timgimyee)
	* Fix patch to restore original if the patch fails (timgimyee)
	* patch uses Term::Readline for prompt (timgimyee)
	* clear tries harder on Windows (timgimyee)

1.012_01 2017-01-14T03:50:20Z
	* Adjust prereq version to Test::Trap to not use leading v,
	which I think is confusing some installers.
	* Ideally, Test::Trap will disappear so we don't have the
	dependency: https://github.com/briandfoy/PerlPowerTools/issues/49

1.012 2017-01-11T13:07:08Z
	* Fix a { for v5.24

	* Fix Makefile to work with v5.8
	* Fix some programs to work with v5.26 (escape { in regexes)

1.011_02 2016-08-31T15:12:44Z
	* A Makefile.PL fix for v5.8

1.011_01 2016-08-31T14:25:21Z
	* Escape { in regexes in dc and glob. Perl v5.26 will demand this.

1.011 2016-08-30T16:52:26Z
	* Back out the Term::UI stuff in bin/patch since that module
	isn't core.

1.009 2016-08-30T08:16:23Z
	* Fix some Makefile.PL issues (pauloscustodio)

1.007_01 2016-03-07T19:05:46Z
	* Exit gracefully in robots if Curses isn't installed
	since a die in a BEGIN is a compilation error when
	triggered
	* Skip -x tests on Windows.

1.007 2016-03-06T18:24:26Z
	* Make it easier to install on Windows (Kevin Phair)
	GitHub issue #32/33

1.006 2015-04-20T23:49:58Z
	* Add docs about the default install location to the
	README and module docs.
	* Fix the diff docs (GitHub #20)

1.005 2015-04-17T01:20:12Z
	* Don't install at the same location as perl. Make the
	user think about where to install them so these tools
	don't interfere with the real tools of the same name.

1.004 - 2014-12-20
	* Try to get first come permissions on ppt so I can close those
	tickets (and release something to replace ppt)

	* Start the TODO file with what needs to happen
	* Fix some programs for v5.21 and disappearing syntax

1.02_01 - 2014-09-14
	* Let's try a different way of running the command to compile
	the programs

1.02 - 2014-09-12
	* Trim the distribution, drastically. Let MetaCPAN be the website.

1.01 - 2014-09-12
	* Let's update Perl Power Tools and make it easier to find - call
	it PerlPowerTools instead of ppt
	* I'm not sure all of the programs even ran, but at least they
	compile now
	* I've probably broken some things, but now I want to see what's
	unauthorized.
