1.016 2019-09-13T13:37:01Z

	* test bin/cat

	* Adjust prereq version to Test::Trap to not use leading v,
	which I think is confusing some installers.
	* Ideally, Test::Trap will disappear so we don't have the
	dependency: https://github.com/briandfoy/PerlPowerTools/issues/49

1.012 2017-01-11T13:07:08Z

	README and module docs.
	* Fix the diff docs (GitHub #20)

1.005 2015-04-17T01:20:12Z
	* Don't install at the same location as perl. Make the
	user think about where to install them so these tools
	don't interfere with the real tools of the same name.

1.004 - 2014-12-20

	it PerlPowerTools instead of ppt
	* I'm not sure all of the programs even ran, but at least they
	compile now
	* I've probably broken some things, but now I want to see what's
	unauthorized.
