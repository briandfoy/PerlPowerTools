=head1 NAME

PerlPowerTools - BSD utilities written in pure Perl

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Install the commands and use them just as you would the normal
BSD utilities.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Unix Reconstruction Project. By default, these install into the
F<~/perlpowertools> directory. You'll probably need to add that directory
to C<PATH> to use them. You can install them anywhere you like by
setting C<INSTALL_BASE> when you run F<Makefile.PL>.
