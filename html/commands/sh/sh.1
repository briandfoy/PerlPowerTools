SYNOPSIS
       sh [ -ceiknrstuvx ] [ arg ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Sh  is  a  command programming language that executes com-
       mands read from a terminal or a file.  See invocation  for
       the meaning of arguments to the shell.

       Commands.
       A  simple-command  is  a sequence of non blank words sepa-
       rated by blanks (a blank is a tab or a space).  The  first
       word  specifies	the  name  of the command to be executed.
       Except as specified below the remaining words  are  passed
       as  arguments to the invoked command.  The command name is
       passed as argument 0 (see exec(2)).  The value of  a  sim-
       ple-command  is	its exit status if it terminates normally
       or 200+status if it terminates abnormally  (see	signal(2)
       for a list of status values).

       A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated
       by |.  The standard output of each command but the last is
       connected  by  a pipe(2) to the standard input of the next
       command.	 Each command is run as a separate  process;  the
       shell waits for the last command to terminate.

       A list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by
       ;, &, && or || and optionally terminated by ; or &.  ; and
       & have equal precedence which is lower than that of && and
       ||, && and || also have	equal  precedence.   A	semicolon
       causes  sequential execution; an ampersand causes the pre-
       ceding pipeline to be executed without waiting for  it  to
       finish.	 The  symbol && (||) causes the list following to
       be executed only if the preceding pipeline returns a  zero
       (non  zero) value.  Newlines may appear in a list, instead
       of semicolons, to delimit commands.

       A command is either a simple-command or one of the follow-
       ing.   The value returned by a command is that of the last
       simple-command executed in the command.

       for name [in word ...] do list done
	      Each time a for command is executed name is set  to
	      the  next	 word in the for word list If in word ...
	      is omitted then in "$@" is assumed.  Execution ends
	      when there are no more words in the list.

       case word in [pattern [ | pattern ] ... ) list ;;] ...
	      esac
	      A case command executes the  list	 associated  with

								1

SH(1)							    SH(1)

	      the  first  pattern that matches word.  The form of
	      the patterns is the same as that used for file name
	      generation.

       if list then list [elif list then list] ... [else list] fi
	      The list following if is executed and if it returns
	      zero  the	 list following then is executed.  Other-
	      wise, the list following elif is	executed  and  if
	      its  value  is zero the list following then is exe-
	      cuted.  Failing that the else list is executed.

       while list [do list] done
	      A while command repeatedly executes the while  list
	      and if its value is zero executes the do list; oth-
	      erwise the loop terminates.  The value returned  by
	      a	 while	command is that of the last executed com-
	      mand in the do list.  until may be used in place of
	      while to negate the loop termination test.

       ( list )
	      Execute list in a subshell.

       { list }
	      list is simply executed.

       The  following words are only recognized as the first word
       of a command and when not quoted.

	      if then else elif fi case in esac for  while  until
	      do done { }

       Command substitution.
       The  standard  output from a command enclosed in a pair of
       grave accents (``) may be used as part or all of	 a  word;
       trailing newlines are removed.

       Parameter substitution.
       The character $ is used to introduce substitutable parame-
       ters.  Positional parameters may	 be  assigned  values  by
       set.  Variables may be set by writing

	      name=value [ name=value ] ...

       ${parameter}
	      A	 parameter  is	a  sequence of letters, digits or
	      underscores (a name), a digit, or any of the  char-
	      acters  *	 @  # ? - $ !.	The value, if any, of the
	      parameter is substituted.	 The braces are	 required
	      only when parameter is followed by a letter, digit,
	      or underscore that is not to be interpreted as part
	      of  its name.  If parameter is a digit then it is a
	      positional parameter.  If parameter is * or @  then
	      all  the	positional  parameters, starting with $1,
	      are substituted separated by  spaces.   $0  is  set

	      from argument zero when the shell is invoked.

       ${parameter-word}
	      If parameter is set then substitute its value; oth-
	      erwise substitute word.

       ${parameter=word}
	      If parameter is not set then set it  to  word;  the
	      value  of the parameter is then substituted.  Posi-
	      tional parameters may not be assigned  to	 in  this
	      way.

       ${parameter?word}
	      If parameter is set then substitute its value; oth-
	      erwise, print word and exit  from	 the  shell.   If
	      word is omitted then a standard message is printed.

       ${parameter+word}
	      If parameter is set then substitute word; otherwise
	      substitute nothing.

       In the above word is not evaluated unless it is to be used
       as the substituted string.  (So that,  for  example,  echo
       ${d-`pwd`} will only execute pwd if d is unset.)

       The  following  parameters  are	automatically  set by the
       shell.

	      #	     The number of positional parameters in deci-
		     mal.
	      -	     Options  supplied to the shell on invocation
		     or by set.
	      ?	     The value returned by the last executed com-
		     mand in decimal.
	      $	     The process number of this shell.
	      !	     The  process  number  of the last background
		     command invoked.

       The following parameters are  used  but	not  set  by  the
       shell.

	      HOME   The  default  argument  (home directory) for
		     the cd command.
	      PATH   The search path  for  commands  (see  execu-
		     tion).
	      MAIL   If	 this  variable	 is  set to the name of a
		     mail file then the shell informs the user of
		     the arrival of mail in the specified file.
	      PS1    Primary prompt string, by default `$ '.
	      PS2    Secondary prompt string, by default `> '.
	      IFS    Internal  field  separators, normally space,
		     tab, and newline.

       Blank interpretation.

SH(1)							    SH(1)

       After parameter and command substitution, any  results  of
       substitution  are  scanned  for	internal  field separator
       characters (those found in $IFS) and split  into	 distinct
       arguments  where such characters are found.  Explicit null
       arguments ("" or '') are retained.   Implicit  null  argu-
       ments  (those  resulting from parameters that have no val-
       ues) are removed.

       File name generation.
       Following substitution, each command word is  scanned  for
       the  characters	*,  ?  and [.  If one of these characters
       appears then the word is regarded as a pattern.	The  word
       is  replaced  with  alphabetically  sorted file names that
       match the pattern.  If no file name is found that  matches
       the  pattern then the word is left unchanged.  The charac-
       ter .  at the start of a file name or immediately  follow-
       ing  a /, and the character /, must be matched explicitly.

       *      Matches any string, including the null string.
       ?      Matches any single character.
       [...]  Matches any one of the characters enclosed.  A pair
	      of  characters separated by - matches any character
	      lexically between the pair.

       Quoting.
       The following characters have a	special	 meaning  to  the
       shell and cause termination of a word unless quoted.

	    ;	&   (	)   |	<   >	newline	  space	  tab

       A character may be quoted by preceding it with a \.  \new-
       line is ignored.	 All characters enclosed between  a  pair
       of  quote  marks	 (''), except a single quote, are quoted.
       Inside double quotes ("") parameter and command	substitu-
       tion occurs and \ quotes the characters \ ` " and $.

       "$*" is equivalent to "$1 $2 ..."  whereas
       "$@" is equivalent to "$1" "$2" ... .

       Prompting.
       When  used interactively, the shell prompts with the value
       of PS1 before reading a command.	 If at any time a newline
       is typed and further input is needed to complete a command
       then the secondary prompt ($PS2) is issued.

       Input output.
       Before a command is executed its input and output  may  be
       redirected  using  a  special  notation interpreted by the
       shell.  The following may appear anywhere in a simple-com-
       mand or may precede or follow a command and are not passed
       on to the invoked  command.   Substitution  occurs  before
       word or digit is used.

       <word  Use  file	 word  as standard input (file descriptor

								4

SH(1)							    SH(1)

	      0).

       >word  Use file word as standard output	(file  descriptor
	      1).  If the file does not exist then it is created;
	      otherwise it is truncated to zero length.

       >>word Use file word as	standard  output.   If	the  file
	      exists  then  output is appended (by seeking to the
	      end); otherwise the file is created.

       <<word The shell input is read up to a line  the	 same  as
	      word,  or	 end  of  file.	  The  resulting document
	      becomes the standard input.  If  any  character  of
	      word  is	quoted	then  no interpretation is placed
	      upon the characters  of  the  document;  otherwise,
	      parameter and command substitution occurs, \newline
	      is ignored, and \ is used to quote the characters \
	      $ ` and the first character of word.

       <&digit
	      The standard input is duplicated from file descrip-
	      tor digit; see dup(2).  Similarly for the	 standard
	      output using >.

       <&-    The  standard  input  is closed.	Similarly for the
	      standard output using >.

       If one of the above is preceded by a digit then	the  file
       descriptor created is that specified by the digit (instead
       of the default 0 or 1).	For example,

	    ... 2>&1

       creates file descriptor	2  to  be  a  duplicate	 of  file
       descriptor 1.

       If  a  command  is followed by & then the default standard
       input for the command is the empty file (/dev/null).  Oth-
       erwise,	the  environment  for  the execution of a command
       contains the file descriptors of	 the  invoking	shell  as
       modified by input output specifications.

       Environment.
       The  environment	 is  a	list  of name-value pairs that is
       passed to an executed program in the same way as a  normal
       argument	 list;	see  exec(2)  and  environ(5).	The shell
       interacts with the environment in several ways.	On  invo-
       cation,	the  shell  scans  the	environment and creates a
       parameter for each name found, giving it the corresponding
       value.	Executed  commands  inherit the same environment.
       If the user modifies the values	of  these  parameters  or
       creates	new  ones,  none of these affects the environment
       unless the export command is  used  to  bind  the  shell's
       parameter to the environment.  The environment seen by any

								5

SH(1)							    SH(1)

       executed command is thus composed of any unmodified  name-
       value  pairs  originally	 inherited by the shell, plus any
       modifications or additions, all of which must be noted  in
       export commands.

       The environment for any simple-command may be augmented by
       prefixing it with one or more assignments  to  parameters.
       Thus these two lines are equivalent

	      TERM=450 cmd args
	      (export TERM; TERM=450; cmd args)

       If the -k flag is set, all keyword arguments are placed in
       the environment, even if the occur after the command name.
       The following prints `a=b c' and `c':
       echo a=b c
       set -k
       echo a=b c

       Signals.
       The  INTERRUPT and QUIT signals for an invoked command are
       ignored if the command is followed by &; otherwise signals
       have  the  values  inherited by the shell from its parent.
       (But see also trap.)

       Execution.
       Each time a command is executed	the  above  substitutions
       are carried out.	 Except for the `special commands' listed
       below a new process is created and an attempt is	 made  to
       execute the command via an exec(2).

       The  shell parameter $PATH defines the search path for the
       directory containing the command.  Each alternative direc-
       tory  name  is separated by a colon (:).	 The default path
       is :/bin:/usr/bin.  If the command name contains a /  then
       the search path is not used.  Otherwise, each directory in
       the path is searched for an executable file.  If the  file
       has  execute  permission	 but  is not an a.out file, it is
       assumed to be a file containing shell  commands.	  A  sub-
       shell (i.e., a separate process) is spawned to read it.	A
       parenthesized command is also executed in a subshell.

       Special commands.
       The following commands are executed in the  shell  process
       and  except where specified no input output redirection is
       permitted for such commands.

       :      No effect; the command does nothing.
       . file Read and execute commands	 from  file  and  return.
	      The search path $PATH is used to find the directory
	      containing file.
       break [n]
	      Exit from the enclosing for or while loop, if  any.
	      If n is specified then break n levels.

								6

SH(1)							    SH(1)

       continue [n]
	      Resume  the  next iteration of the enclosing for or
	      while loop.  If n is specified then resume  at  the
	      n-th enclosing loop.
       cd [arg]
	      Change  the  current  directory  to arg.	The shell
	      parameter $HOME is the default arg.
       eval [arg ...]
	      The arguments are read as input to  the  shell  and
	      the resulting command(s) executed.
       exec [arg ...]
	      The  command specified by the arguments is executed
	      in place of this shell without creating a new  pro-
	      cess.   Input output arguments may appear and if no
	      other arguments are given	 cause	the  shell  input
	      output to be modified.
       exit [n]
	      Causes  a	 non  interactive  shell to exit with the
	      exit status specified by n.  If n is  omitted  then
	      the  exit	 status	 is that of the last command exe-
	      cuted.  (An end of file will  also  exit	from  the
	      shell.)
       export [name ...]
	      The  given names are marked for automatic export to
	      the environment of subsequently-executed	commands.
	      If no arguments are given then a list of exportable
	      names is printed.
       login [arg ...]
	      Equivalent to `exec login arg ...'.
       newgrp [arg ...]
	      Equivalent to `exec newgrp arg ...'.
       read name ...
	      One line is read from the standard  input;  succes-
	      sive  words  of the input are assigned to the vari-
	      ables name in order, with	 leftover  words  to  the
	      last  variable.	The  return  code is 0 unless the
	      end-of-file is encountered.
       readonly [name ...]
	      The given names are marked readonly and the  values
	      of the these names may not be changed by subsequent
	      assignment.  If no arguments are given then a  list
	      of all readonly names is printed.
       set [-eknptuvx [arg ...]]
	      -e If  non  interactive  then exit immediately if a
		 command fails.
	      -k All keyword arguments are placed in the environ-
		 ment  for a command, not just those that precede
		 the command name.
	      -n Read commands but do not execute them.
	      -t Exit after reading and executing one command.
	      -u Treat unset variables as an error  when  substi-
		 tuting.
	      -v Print shell input lines as they are read.
	      -x Print	commands  and their arguments as they are

		 executed.
	      -	 Turn off the -x and -v options.

	      These flags can also be used upon invocation of the
	      shell.   The  current  set of flags may be found in
	      $-.

	      Remaining arguments are positional  parameters  and
	      are  assigned,  in  order,  to  $1, $2, etc.  If no
	      arguments are given then the values  of  all  names
	      are printed.

       shift  The  positional  parameters from $2...  are renamed
	      $1...

       times  Print the accumulated user  and  system  times  for
	      processes run from the shell.

       trap [arg] [n] ...
	      Arg  is  a command to be read and executed when the
	      shell receives signal(s)	n.   (Note  that  arg  is
	      scanned once when the trap is set and once when the
	      trap is taken.)	Trap  commands	are  executed  in
	      order  of signal number.	If arg is absent then all
	      trap(s) n are reset to their original  values.   If
	      arg  is the null string then this signal is ignored
	      by the shell and by invoked commands.  If	 n  is	0
	      then  the	 command arg is executed on exit from the
	      shell, otherwise upon receipt of signal n	 as  num-
	      bered  in signal(2).  Trap with no arguments prints
	      a list of commands associated with each signal num-
	      ber.

       umask [ nnn ]
	      The  user	 file  creation	 mask is set to the octal
	      value nnn (see umask(2)).	 If nnn is  omitted,  the
	      current value of the mask is printed.

       wait [n]
	      Wait  for the specified process and report its ter-
	      mination status.	If n is not given then	all  cur-
	      rently  active child processes are waited for.  The
	      return code from this command is that of	the  pro-
	      cess waited for.

       Invocation.
       If the first character of argument zero is -, commands are
       read from $HOME/.profile, if such a file exists.	 Commands
       are then read as described below.  The following flags are
       interpreted by the shell when it is invoked.
       -c string  If the -c flag is  present  then  commands  are
		  read from string.
       -s	  If  the  -s  flag is present or if no arguments

								8

SH(1)							    SH(1)

		  remain then commands are read from the standard
		  input.    Shell   output  is	written	 to  file
		  descriptor 2.
       -i	  If the -i flag is present or if the shell input
		  and  output are attached to a terminal (as told
		  by gtty) then this shell  is	interactive.   In
		  this	case  the  terminate  signal SIGTERM (see
		  signal(2)) is ignored (so that  `kill	 0'  does
		  not  kill  an interactive shell) and the inter-
		  rupt signal SIGINT is caught	and  ignored  (so
		  that	wait  is  interruptable).   In	all cases
		  SIGQUIT is ignored by the shell.

       The remaining flags and arguments are described under  the
       set command.

FILES
       $HOME/.profile
       /tmp/sh*
       /dev/null

SEE ALSO
       test(1), exec(2),

DIAGNOSTICS
       Errors  detected by the shell, such as syntax errors cause
       the shell to return a non zero exit status.  If the  shell
       is  being  used	non  interactively  then execution of the
       shell file is abandoned.	 Otherwise, the shell returns the
       exit  status of the last command executed (see also exit).

BUGS
       If << is used to provide standard input to an asynchronous
       process invoked by &, the shell gets mixed up about naming
       the input document.  A garbage file /tmp/sh*  is	 created,
       and  the	 shell complains about not being able to find the
       file by another name.
