NAME
       join - relational database operator

SYNOPSIS
       join [ options ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       Join  forms,  on	 the  standard	output, a join of the two
       relations specified by the lines of file1 and  file2.   If
       file1 is `-', the standard input is used.

       File1 and file2 must be sorted in increasing ASCII collat-
       ing sequence on the fields on which they are to be joined,
       normally the first in each line.

       There  is one line in the output for each pair of lines in
       file1 and file2 that have identical join fields.	 The out-
       put  line  normally consists of the common field, then the
       rest of the line from file1, then the  rest  of	the  line
       from file2.

       Fields  are  normally  separated by blank, tab or newline.
       In this case, multiple separators count as one, and  lead-
       ing separators are discarded.

       These options are recognized:

       -an    In  addition  to	the normal output, produce a line
	      for each unpairable line in file n, where n is 1 or
	      2.

       -e s   Replace empty output fields by string s.

       -jn m  Join  on the mth field of file n.	 If n is missing,
	      use the mth field in each file.

       -o list
	      Each output line comprises the fields  specifed  in
	      list, each element of which has the form n.m, where
	      n is a file number and m is a field number.

       -tc    Use character c as  a  separator	(tab  character).
	      Every appearance of c in a line is significant.

BUGS
       With  default  field separation, the collating sequence is
       that of sort -b; with -t, the sequence is that of a  plain
       sort.

       The conventions of join, sort, comm, uniq, look and awk(1)
