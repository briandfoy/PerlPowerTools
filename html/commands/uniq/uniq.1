UNIQ(1)							  UNIQ(1)

NAME
       uniq - report repeated lines in a file

SYNOPSIS
       uniq [ -udc [ +n ] [ -n ] ] [ input [ output ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Uniq  reads  the	 input file comparing adjacent lines.  In
       the normal case,	 the  second  and  succeeding  copies  of
       repeated	 lines	are  removed; the remainder is written on
       the output file.	 Note that repeated lines must	be  adja-
       cent in order to be found; see sort(1).	If the -u flag is
       used, just the lines that are not repeated in the original
       file are output.	 The -d option specifies that one copy of
       just the repeated lines is to be written.  The normal mode
       output is the union of the -u and -d mode outputs.

       The -c option supersedes -u and -d and generates an output
       report in default style but with each line preceded  by	a
       count of the number of times it occurred.

       The  n  arguments  specify  skipping an initial portion of
       each line in the comparison:

       -n      The first n fields together with any blanks before
	       each  are ignored.  A field is defined as a string
	       of non-space, non-tab characters separated by tabs
	       and spaces from its neighbors.

       +n      The  first  n  characters are ignored.  Fields are
	       skipped before characters.
