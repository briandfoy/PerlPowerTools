NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep - search a file for a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       grep [ option ] ...  expression [ file ] ...

       egrep [ option ] ...  [ expression ] [ file ] ...

       fgrep [ option ] ...  [ strings ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Commands	 of the grep family search the input files (stan-
       dard input default) for lines matching  a  pattern.   Nor-
       mally,  each  line found is copied to the standard output;
       unless the -h flag is used, the	file  name  is	shown  if
       there is more than one input file.

       Grep patterns are limited regular expressions in the style
       of ed(1); it uses a  compact  nondeterministic  algorithm.
       Egrep  patterns	are  full  regular expressions; it uses a
       fast deterministic algorithm that sometimes needs exponen-
       tial  space.  Fgrep patterns are fixed strings; it is fast
       and compact.

       The following options are recognized.

       -v     All lines but those matching are printed.

       -c     Only a count of matching lines is printed.

       -l     The names of files with matching lines  are  listed
	      (once) separated by newlines.

       -n     Each  line  is  preceded	by its line number in the
	      file.

       -b     Each line is preceded by the block number on  which
	      it was found.  This is sometimes useful in locating
	      disk block numbers by context.

       -s     No output is produced, only status.

       -h     Do not print filename headers with output lines.

       -y     Lower case letters in the pattern will  also  match
	      upper case letters in the input (grep only).

       -e expression
	      Same  as	a  simple expression argument, but useful
	      when the expression begins with a -.

       -f file
	      The  regular  expression	(egrep)	 or  string  list
	      (fgrep) is taken from the file.

       -x     (Exact)  only  lines  matched in their entirety are
	      printed (fgrep only).

       Care should be taken when using the characters $ * [ ^ | ?
       '  " ( ) and \ in the expression as they are also meaning-
       ful to the Shell.  It is	 safest	 to  enclose  the  entire
       expression argument in single quotes ' '.

       Fgrep searches for lines that contain one of the (newline-
       separated) strings.

       Egrep accepts extended regular expressions.  In	the  fol-
       lowing description `character' excludes newline:

	      A	 \  followed  by  a single character matches that
	      character.

	      The character ^ ($) matches the beginning (end)  of
	      a line.

	      A .  matches any character.

	      A	 single character not otherwise endowed with spe-
	      cial meaning matches that character.

	      A string enclosed in brackets [] matches any single
	      character from the string.  Ranges of ASCII charac-
	      ter codes may be abbreviated as in `a-z0-9'.   A	]
	      may  occur  only	as  the	 first	character  of the
	      string.  A literal - must be placed where it  can't
	      be mistaken as a range indicator.

	      A regular expression followed by * (+, ?) matches a
	      sequence of 0 or more (1 or more, 0 or  1)  matches
	      of the regular expression.

	      Two  regular expressions concatenated match a match
	      of the first followed by a match of the second.

	      Two regular expressions separated by |  or  newline
	      match  either  a match for the first or a match for
	      the second.

	      A	 regular  expression  enclosed	 in   parentheses
	      matches a match for the regular expression.

       The order of precedence of operators at the same parenthe-
       sis level is [] then *+? then  concatenation  then  |  and
       newline.

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit  status  is	 0 if any matches are found, 1 if none, 2
       for syntax errors or inaccessible files.

BUGS
       Ideally there should be only one grep, but we don't know a
       single  algorithm that spans a wide enough range of space-
       time tradeoffs.

       Lines are limited to  256  characters;  longer  lines  are
       truncated.
