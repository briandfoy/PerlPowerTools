NAME
       test -  condition command

SYNOPSIS
       test expr

DESCRIPTION
       test  evaluates	the  expression expr, and if its value is
       true then returns zero exit status; otherwise, a non  zero
       exit  status is returned.  test returns a non zero exit if
       there are no arguments.

       The following primitives are used to construct expr.

       -r file	true if the file exists and is readable.

       -w file	true if the file exists and is writable.

       -f file	true if the file exists and is not a directory.

       -d file	true if the file exists and is a directory.

       -s file	true if the file exists and has	 a  size  greater
		than zero.

       -t [ fildes ]
		true  if the open file whose file descriptor num-
		ber is fildes (1 by default) is associated with a
		terminal device.

       -z s1	true if the length of string s1 is zero.

       -n s1	true if the length of the string s1 is nonzero.

       s1 = s2	true if the strings s1 and s2 are equal.

       s1 != s2 true if the strings s1 and s2 are not equal.

       s1	true if s1 is not the null string.

       n1 -eq n2
		true  if the integers n1 and n2 are algebraically
		equal.	Any of the  comparisons	 -ne,  -gt,  -ge,
		-lt, or -le may be used in place of -eq.

       These  primaries may be combined with the following opera-
       tors:

       !      unary negation operator

       -a     binary and operator

       -o     binary or operator

       ( expr )
	      parentheses for grouping.

       -a has higher precedence than -o.   Notice  that	 all  the
       operators  and  flags  are  separate  arguments	to  test.
       Notice also that parentheses are meaningful to  the  Shell
       and must be escaped.
