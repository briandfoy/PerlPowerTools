NAME
       eqn, neqn, checkeq  -  typeset mathematics

SYNOPSIS
       eqn [ -dxy ] [ -pn ] [ -sn ] [ -fn ] [ file ] ...
       checkeq [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Eqn is a troff(1) preprocessor for typesetting mathematics
       on a Graphic Systems phototypesetter, neqn  on  terminals.
       Usage is almost always

	    eqn file ... | troff
	    neqn file ... | nroff

       If  no  files are specified, these programs reads from the
       standard input.	A line beginning  with	`.EQ'  marks  the
       start  of an equation; the end of an equation is marked by
       a line beginning with `.EN'.  Neither of	 these	lines  is
       altered,	 so  they may be defined in macro packages to get
       centering, numbering, etc.  It is also possible to set two
       characters as `delimiters'; subsequent text between delim-
       iters is also treated as eqn input.  Delimiters may be set
       to  characters x and y with the command-line argument -dxy
       or (more commonly) with `delim xy' between  .EQ	and  .EN.
       The  left  and  right delimiters may be identical.  Delim-
       iters are turned off by `delim off'.   All  text	 that  is
       neither	between	 delimiters  nor  between  .EQ and .EN is
       passed through untouched.

       The program checkeq reports missing or  unbalanced  delim-
       iters and .EQ/.EN pairs.

       Tokens within eqn are separated by spaces, tabs, newlines,
       braces, double quotes, tildes or circumflexes.  Braces  {}
       are used for grouping; generally speaking, anywhere a sin-
       gle character like x could appear, a complicated construc-
       tion enclosed in braces may be used instead.  Tilde ~ rep-
       resents a full space in the output, circumflex ^	 half  as
       much.

       Subscripts and superscripts are produced with the keywords
       sub and sup.  Thus x sub i makes $x sub i$, a sub i sup	2
       produces	 $a  sub  i sup 2$, and e sup {x sup 2 + y sup 2}
       gives $e sup {x sup 2 + y sup 2}$.

       Fractions are made with over: a over b yields $a over  b$.

       sqrt  makes  square  roots:  1  over sqrt {ax sup 2 +bx+c}
       results in $1 over sqrt {ax sup 2 +bx+c}$ .

       The keywords from and to introduce lower and upper  limits
       on arbitrary things: $lim from {n-> inf} sum from 0 to n x
       sub i$ is made with lim from {n-> inf } sum from 0 to n	x
       sub i.

       Left and right brackets, braces, etc., of the right height
       are made with left and right: left [ x sup 2  +	y  sup	2

       over alpha right ] ~=~1 produces $left [ x sup 2 + y sup 2
       over alpha right ] ~=~1$.  The right clause  is	optional.
       Legal  characters  after left and right are braces, brack-
       ets, bars, c and f for ceiling and floor, and "" for noth-
       ing at all (useful for a right-side-only bracket).

       Vertical piles of things are made with pile, lpile, cpile,
       and rpile: pile {a above b  above  c}  produces	$pile  {a
       above  b	 above	c}$.  There can be an arbitrary number of
       elements in a pile.  lpile left-justifies, pile and  cpile
       center,	with  different vertical spacing, and rpile right
       justifies.

       Matrices are made with matrix: matrix { lcol  {	x  sub	i
       above  y	 sub  2 } ccol { 1 above 2 } } produces $matrix {
       lcol { x sub i above y sub 2 } ccol { 1 above 2 } }$.   In
       addition, there is rcol for a right-justified column.

       Diacritical  marks  are made with dot, dotdot, hat, tilde,
       bar, vec, dyad, and under: x dot = f(t) bar is  $x  dot	=
       f(t) bar$, y dotdot bar ~=~ n under is $y dotdot bar ~=~ n
       under$, and x vec ~=~ y dyad is $x vec ~=~ y dyad$.

       Sizes and font can be changed with size	n  or  size  +-n,
       roman,  italic,	bold,  and font n.  Size and fonts can be
       changed globally in a document by gsize n and gfont n,  or
       by the command-line arguments -sn and -fn.

       Normally	 subscripts  and  superscripts	are  reduced by 3
       point sizes from the previous size; this may be changed by
       the command-line argument -pn.

       Successive  display arguments can be lined up.  Place mark
       before the desired lineup point	in  the	 first	equation;
       place lineup at the place that is to line up vertically in
       subsequent equations.

       Shorthands may be defined or existing  keywords	redefined
       with  define:  define  thing % replacement % defines a new
       token called thing which will be replaced  by  replacement
       whenever	 it appears thereafter.	 The % may be any charac-
       ter that does not occur in replacement.

       Keywords like sum ( sum ) int ( int )  inf  (  inf  )  and
       shorthands  like >= (>=) -> (->), and != ( != ) are recog-
       nized.  Greek letters are spelled out in the desired case,
       as  in  alpha or GAMMA.	Mathematical words like sin, cos,
       log are made Roman automatically.  Troff(1) four-character
       escapes	like  \(bs  ()	can  be	 used  anywhere.  Strings
       enclosed	 in  double  quotes  "..."   are  passed  through
       untouched;  this	 permits  keywords to be entered as text,
       and can be used to communicate with troff  when	all  else
       fails.
