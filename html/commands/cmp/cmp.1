NAME
       cmp - compare two files

SYNOPSIS
       cmp [ -l ] [ -s ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       The  two	 files are compared.  (If file1 is `-', the stan-
       dard input is used.)  Under default options, cmp makes  no
       comment	if  the	 files	are  the same; if they differ, it
       announces the byte and line number at which the difference
       occurred.   If  one  file is an initial subsequence of the
       other, that fact is noted.

       Options:

       -l    Print the byte number (decimal)  and  the	differing
	     bytes (octal) for each difference.

       -s    Print  nothing  for  differing  files;  return codes
	     only.

SEE ALSO
       diff(1), comm(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
       Exit code 0 is returned for identical files, 1 for differ-
       ent  files, and 2 for an inaccessible or missing argument.
