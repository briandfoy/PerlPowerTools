NAME
       troff, nroff - text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS
       troff [ option ] ...  [ file ] ...

       nroff [ option ] ...  [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Troff  formats  text  in the named files for printing on a
       Graphic Systems C/A/T  phototypesetter;	nroff  for  type-
       writer-like  devices.  Their capabilities are described in
       the Nroff/Troff user's manual.

       If no file argument is  present,	 the  standard	input  is
       read.   An  argument  consisting	 of a single minus (-) is
       taken to be a file  name	 corresponding	to  the	 standard
       input.  The options, which may appear in any order so long
       as they appear before the files, are:

       -olist Print only pages whose page numbers appear  in  the
	      comma-separated  list  of	 numbers  and  ranges.	A
	      range N-M means pages N through M;  an  initial  -N
	      means  from the beginning to page N; and a final N-
	      means from N to the end.

       -nN    Number first generated page N.

       -sN    Stop every N pages.  Nroff will halt prior to every
	      N	 pages	(default  N=1)	to allow paper loading or
	      changing, and will resume upon receipt  of  a  new-
	      line.   Troff will stop the phototypesetter every N
	      pages, produce a trailer	to  allow  changing  cas-
	      settes, and resume when the typesetter's start but-
	      ton is pressed.

       -mname Prepend the macro file  /usr/lib/tmac/tmac.name  to
	      the input files.

       -raN   Set register a (one-character) to N.

       -i     Read  standard  input  after  the	 input	files are
	      exhausted.

       -q     Invoke the simultaneous input-output mode of the rd
	      request.

       Nroff only

       -Tname Prepare output for specified terminal.  Known names
	      are 37 for the (default) Teletype Corporation Model
	      37  terminal, tn300 for the GE TermiNet 300 (or any
	      terminal without half-line  capability),	300S  for
	      the  DASI-300S,  300  for the DASI-300, and 450 for

	      the DASI-450 (Diablo Hyterm).

       -e     Produce equally-spaced  words  in	 adjusted  lines,
	      using full terminal resolution.

       -h     Use  output tabs during horizontal spacing to speed
	      output and reduce output character count.	 Tab set-
	      tings  are  assumed to be every 8 nominal character
	      widths.

       Troff only

       -t     Direct output to the standard output instead of the
	      phototypesetter.

       -f     Refrain  from feeding out paper and stopping photo-
	      typesetter at the end of the run.

       -w     Wait until phototypesetter is  available,	 if  cur-
	      rently busy.

       -b     Report  whether  the  phototypesetter  is	 busy  or
	      available.  No text processing is done.

       -a     Send a printable ASCII approximation of the results
	      to the standard output.

       -pN    Print  all characters in point size N while retain-
	      ing all prescribed spacings and motions, to  reduce
	      phototypesetter elasped time.

       -g     Prepare  output  for  a  GCOS  phototypesetter  and
	      direct it to the standard output (see gcat(1)).

       If the file /usr/adm/tracct is writable, troff keeps  pho-
       totypesetter  accounting	 records there.	 The integrity of
       that file may be secured by making troff a  `set	 user-id'
       program.
