NAME
       deroff - remove nroff, troff, tbl and eqn constructs

SYNOPSIS
       deroff [ -w ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Deroff  reads  each file in sequence and removes all nroff
       and troff command lines,	 backslash  constructions,  macro
       definitions, eqn constructs (between `.EQ' and `.EN' lines
       or between delimiters), and table descriptions and  writes
       the  remainder  on  the	standard  output.  Deroff follows
       chains of included files (`.so' and `.nx' commands); if	a
       file  has  already been included, a `.so' is ignored and a
       `.nx' terminates execution.  If no input	 file  is  given,
       deroff reads from the standard input file.

       If  the	-w  flag is given, the output is a word list, one
       `word' (string of letters, digits, and apostrophes, begin-
       ning with a letter; apostrophes are removed) per line, and
       all other characters ignored.  Otherwise, the output  fol-
       lows the original, with the deletions mentioned above.

SEE ALSO
       troff(1), eqn(1), tbl(1)

BUGS
       Deroff  is  not a complete troff interpreter, so it can be
       confused by subtle constructs.  Most errors result in  too
       much rather than too little output.
