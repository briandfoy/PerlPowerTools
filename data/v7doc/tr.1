NAME
       tr - translate characters

SYNOPSIS
       tr [ -cds ] [ string1 [ string2 ] ]

DESCRIPTION
       Tr  copies  the standard input to the standard output with
       substitution or deletion of  selected  characters.   Input
       characters  found  in  string1  are mapped into the corre-
       sponding characters of string2.	When string2 is short  it
       is padded to the length of string1 by duplicating its last
       character.  Any combination of the  options  -cds  may  be
       used: -c complements the set of characters in string1 with
       respect to the universe of characters  whose  ASCII  codes
       are 01 through 0377 octal; -d deletes all input characters
       in string1; -s squeezes all  strings  of	 repeated  output
       characters that are in string2 to single characters.

       In either string the notation a-b means a range of charac-
       ters from a to b in increasing ASCII order.  The character
       `\'  followed  by  1,  2	 or 3 octal digits stands for the
       character whose ASCII code is given by  those  digits.	A
       `\'  followed by any other character stands for that char-
       acter.

       The following example creates a list of all the	words  in
       `file1'	one per line in `file2', where a word is taken to
       be a maximal string of alphabetics.  The second string  is
       quoted  to  protect  `\' from the Shell.	 012 is the ASCII
       code for newline.

	      tr -cs A-Za-z '\012' <file1 >file2

SEE ALSO
       ed(1), ascii(7)

BUGS
       Won't handle ASCII  NUL	in  string1  or	 string2;  always
       deletes NUL from input.
