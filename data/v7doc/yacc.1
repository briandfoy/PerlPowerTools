NAME
       yacc - yet another compiler-compiler

SYNOPSIS
       yacc [ -vd ] grammar

DESCRIPTION
       Yacc  converts a context-free grammar into a set of tables
       for a simple automaton which  executes  an  LR(1)  parsing
       algorithm.  The grammar may be ambiguous; specified prece-
       dence rules are used to break ambiguities.

       The output file, y.tab.c, must be compiled by the  C  com-
       piler  to produce a program yyparse.  This program must be
       loaded with the lexical analyzer program, yylex,	 as  well
       as  main	 and  yyerror,	an error handling routine.  These
       routines must be supplied by the user;  Lex(1)  is  useful
       for creating lexical analyzers usable by yacc.

       If  the	-v  flag is given, the file y.output is prepared,
       which contains a description of the parsing tables  and	a
       report  on conflicts generated by ambiguities in the gram-
       mar.

       If the -d flag is used, the file y.tab.h is generated with
       the  define  statements	that  associate the yacc-assigned
       `token codes' with the user-declared `token names'.   This
       allows source files other than y.tab.c to access the token
       codes.

FILES
       y.output
       y.tab.c
       y.tab.h		   defines for token names
       yacc.tmp, yacc.acts temporary files
       /usr/lib/yaccpar	   parser prototype for C programs
       /lib/liby.a	   library with default `main' and `yyer-
       ror'

DIAGNOSTICS
       The number of reduce-reduce and shift-reduce conflicts  is
       reported on the standard output; a more detailed report is
       found in the y.output file.  Similarly, if some rules  are
       not   reachable	from  the  start  symbol,  this	 is  also
       reported.

BUGS
       Because file names are fixed, at most one yacc process can
