NAME
       lex - generator of lexical analysis programs

SYNOPSIS
       lex [ -tvfn ] [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Lex  generates  programs to be used in simple lexical ana-
       lyis of text.  The input files  (standard  input	 default)
       contain	regular	 expressions  to  be  searched	for,  and
       actions written in C to be executed when	 expressions  are
       found.

       A  C  source  program, `lex.yy.c' is generated, to be com-
       piled thus:

	      cc lex.yy.c -ll

       This program, when run, copies  unrecognized  portions  of
       the  input  to  the  output, and executes the associated C
       action for each regular expression that is recognized.

       The following lex program converts upper	 case  to  lower,
       removes	blanks at the end of lines, and replaces multiple
       blanks by single blanks.

	      %%
	      [A-Z] putchar(yytext[0]+'a'-'A');
	      [ ]+$
	      [ ]+  putchar(' ');

       The options have the following meanings.

       -t     Place the result on the standard output instead  of
	      in file `lex.yy.c'.

       -v     Print  a one-line summary of statistics of the gen-
	      erated analyzer.

       -n     Opposite of -v; -n is default.

       -f     `Faster' compilation:  don't  bother  to	pack  the
	      resulting tables; limited to small programs.
