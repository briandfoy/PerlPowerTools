NAME
       roff  -	format text

SYNOPSIS
       roff [ +n ] [ -n ] [ -s ] [ -h ] file ...

       nroff -mr [ option ] ... file ...
       troff -mr [ option ] ... file ...

DESCRIPTION
       Roff  formats  text according to control lines embedded in
       the text in the given files.  Encountering  a  nonexistent
       file  terminates	 printing.   Incoming inter-terminal mes-
       sages are turned off during printing.  The  optional  flag
       arguments mean:
       +n   Start printing at the first page with number n.
       -n   Stop  printing at the first page numbered higher than
	    n.
       -s   Stop before each page (including the first) to  allow
	    paper manipulation; resume on receipt of an interrupt
	    signal.
       -h   Insert tabs in the output stream  to  replace  spaces
	    whenever appropriate.

       Input  consists	of  intermixed	text lines, which contain
       information to be formatted, and request lines, which con-
       tain  instructions  about how to format it.  Request lines
       begin with a distinguished control character,  normally	a
       period.

       Output  lines  may  be  filled  as nearly as possible with
       words without regard to input lineation.	 Line breaks  may
       be  caused  at specified places by certain commands, or by
       the appearance of an empty input line  or  an  input  line
       beginning with a space.

       The  capabilities  of  roff  are specified in the attached
       Request Summary.	 Numerical values are denoted there by	n
       or  +n,	titles by t, and single characters by c.  Numbers
       denoted +n may be signed + or -, in which case  they  sig-
       nify  relative  changes to a quantity, otherwise they sig-
       nify an absolute resetting.  Missing n fields are ordinar-
       ily  taken  to  be  1, missing t fields to be empty, and c
       fields to shut off the appropriate special interpretation.

       Running	titles	usually appear at top and bottom of every
       page.  They are set by requests like

		 .he 'part1'part2'part3'

       Part1 is left justified, part2 is centered, and	part3  is
       right  justified	 on  the  page.	 Any % sign in a title is
       replaced by the current page  number.   Any  nonblank  may
       serve as a quote.

       ASCII  tab  characters  are  replaced  in  the  input by a
       replacement character, normally a space, according to  the
       column  settings given by a .ta command.	 (See .tr for how
       to convert this character on output.)

       Automatic hyphenation of filled output is done under  con-
       trol  of	 .hy.	When a word contains a designated hyphen-
       ation character, that character disappears from the output
       and  hyphens can be introduced into the word at the marked
       places only.

       The -mr option of nroff or troff(1) simulates roff to  the
       greatest extent possible.

BUGS
       Roff  is the simplest of the text formatting programs, and
       is utterly frozen.
