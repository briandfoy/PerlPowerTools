SYNOPSIS
       pubindex [ file ] ...

DESCRIPTION
       Pubindex	 makes a hashed inverted index to the named files
       for use by refer(1).  The files contain bibliographic ref-
       erences	separated by blank lines.  A bibliographic refer-
       ence is a set of lines that contain bibliographic informa-
       tion fields.  Each field starts on a line beginning with a
       `%', followed by a key-letter, followed by  a  blank,  and
       followed	 by  the  contents  of the field, which continues
       until the next line starting with `%'.	The  most  common
       key-letters and the corresponding fields are:

	      A	   Author name
	      B	   Title of book containing article referenced
	      C	   City
	      D	   Date
	      d	   Alternate date
	      E	   Editor of book containing article referenced
	      G	   Government (CFSTI) order number
	      I	   Issuer (publisher)
	      J	   Journal
	      K	   Other keywords to use in locating reference
	      M	   Technical memorandum number
	      N	   Issue number within volume
	      O	   Other commentary to be printed at end of reference
	      P	   Page numbers
	      R	   Report number
	      r	   Alternate report number
	      T	   Title of article, book, etc.
	      V	   Volume number
	      X	   Commentary unused by pubindex

       Except  for  `A',  each	field  should only be given once.
       Only relevant fields should be supplied.	 An example is:

	      %T 5-by-5 Palindromic Word Squares
	      %A M. D. McIlroy
	      %J Word Ways
	      %V 9
