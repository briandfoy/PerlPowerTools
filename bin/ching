ching - the Book of Changes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<ching> [B<-n>] [B<-r>] [B<-h>] [B<-p> I<program>] [I<hexagram-lines>]

=cut

## usage

sub usage { die "usage:  ching [-nrh] [-p pager] [hexagram-number]\n"; }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The I<I Ching> or I<Book of Changes> is an ancient Chinese oracle that
has been in use for centuries as a source of wisdom and advice.

The text of the I<oracle> (as it is sometimes known) consists of
sixty-four I<hexagrams>, each symbolized by a particular arrangement
of six straight (---) and broken (S<- ->) lines.

Each hexagram consists of two major sections.  The B<Judgement>
relates specifically to the matter at hand (For instance, "It furthers
one to have somewhere to go.") while the B<Image> describes the
general attributes of the hexagram and how they apply to one's own
life ("Thus the superior man makes himself strong and untiring.").

=head2 The Lines

The lines are associated with numeric values ranging from six through
nine.  The even values (6 and 8) indicate broken lines, while the odd
values (7 and 9) indicate solid lines.

When the value is six or nine, the line is said to be I<moving>; for
any such line there is an appended judgement which becomes
significant.  Furthermore, the moving lines are inherently unstable
and change into their opposites; a second hexagram (and thus an
additional judgement) is formed.

The numeric value of a hexagram is constructed by listing the digits
corresponding to each of the lines, going from the bottom upward.

=cut

## These are the traditional numeric values for the lines:
# 6 --- "old yin":    broken (yin) moving to solid (yang)
# 7 --- "young yang": solid (yang)
# 8 --- "young yin":  broken (yin)
# 9 --- "old yang":   solid (yang) moving to broken (yin)

use vars qw( @hex_lines %hexagram );

## Traditional ordering of the hexagrams

## hexagram generation code

=head2 Consulting the Oracle

Normally, one consults the oracle by fixing the desired question
firmly in mind and then casting a set of changes (lines) using
yarrow-stalks or tossed coins.  The resulting hexagram will be the
answer to the question.

This oracle simply reads a question from the standard input (up to an
C<EOF>, or a period on a line by itself) and hashes the individual
characters in combination with the time of day, process ID and the
user's user and group IDs.  The resulting value is used as the seed of
a random number generator which drives a simulated coin-toss
divination.  The answer is then formatted and written to the standard
output.

=cut

# Read the question and hash it by adding all the characters together.
# Then get a set of six lines making up a change (pair of hexagrams).
sub ask_and_toss {
  my $question = 0;

  print STDERR "Type your question now.  ",
               "End with control-D or a dot on a line by itself.\n"
    if -t STDIN;

 LINE:
  while (<STDIN>) {
    last LINE if /^\.$/;
    $question += unpack('%8C*', $_);
  }

  srand(time + (31 * $question) + $< + $( + $$);

  # There are two traditional methods of generating line values.
  # What we do here, for each line, is to toss 3 (imaginary) coins,
  # count the number of heads and add 6.  If we were really hardcore,
  # we'd instead simulate the mechanical interactions of a bunch of
  # (imaginary) yarrow stalks, which is considered a superior method
  # of consulting the Oracle.  Patches are welcome. =)

## parsing command line args

=head1 OPTIONS

The B<-n> option will cause *ROFF commands to be piped through nroff(1)
for output formatting, as they were in original BSD implementation.  By
default, the formatting is done by the C<ching> program itself.

The B<-r> option will cause *ROFF formatting commands to be sent to the
standard output.  You probably won't find this very useful unless you're
debugging the B<-n> switch.

The B<-p> option specifies the command to use to display the output.
The default is the value of the environment variable CHING_PAGER, or
of PAGER, or none if neither environment variable is set.

For those who wish to remain steadfast in the old traditions, the
oracle will also accept the results of a personal divination using
yarrow sticks or coins.  To do this, cast the change and then type the
resulting line values as an argument.

Conversely, the B<-h> option can be used to display the line values
from a divination cast by the computer.
