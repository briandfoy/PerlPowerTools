=head1 NAME

words - find words which can be made from a string of letters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<words> [B<-w> I<word-file>] [B<-m> I<min-length>] I<letters>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<words> prints all the uncapitalized words in the word list that can
be made from the string of letters.  Each letter can appear in a word
once for each time it appears in the string.

=head2 OPTIONS

B<words> accepts the following options:

=over 4

=item B<-w> I<word-file>

By default, B<words> looks for a word-file named 'wordlist' in the
same directory as the executable.  Use the B<-w> option to specify the
path to an alternate word list.

=item B<-m> I<min-length>

By default, B<words> prints words of any length that can be made from
the string of letters.  Use the B<-m> option to specify the minimum
length of each word.  B<words> will skip any words that are less than
the specified length.

=back

=head1 FILES

=over 4

=item F<wordlist>

The list of words, found with the executable.

For a comprehensive word list, the author recommends the ENABLE word
list, with more than 172,000 words, which can be found at
http://personal.riverusers.com/~thegrendel/software.html.
