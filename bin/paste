=head1 NAME

paste - merge corresponding or subsequent lines of files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

paste [-s] [-d list] [file...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Paste combines the corresponding lines of multiple files. Each line of each
file is printed seperated by tab (or by the characters listed in the -d
option).  If no files are specified, stdin is read.

=head2 OPTIONS

I<paste> accepts the following options:

=over 4

=item -d list

Define the column delimiters. Each character in this list will be used
one at a time, as a delimiter for the columns. If there are fewer characters
than columns, the characters will be repeated. Standard Perl special characters
("\n", "\t", etc.) are recognized.

=item -s

Displays the output one file per row, rather than interleaving the
lines of the files.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The working of I<paste> is not influenced by any environment variables.

=head1 BUGS

I<paste> has no known bugs, unless you count the use of eval EXPR. Getting
it to work under 'strict refs' would be nice, too.

=head1 AUTHOR

The Perl implementation of I<paste>
was written by Randy Yarger, I<randy.yarger@nextel.com>.
