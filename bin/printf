=head1 NAME

printf - format and print data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<printf> I<format> [ I<argument> ... ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<printf> command uses the first argument as the format that describes
how to print the remaining arguments.  Unlike the standard
printf(1) command, this one uses the Perl version, which means
that the C<\v> escape is not supported, but various other things are.
See L<perlfunc/sprintf> for details.

=head1 RESTRICTIONS

This command should not be used in setuid programs as it does not run
untaint its argments and will trigger errors like C<Insecure dependency
in eval while running setuid at /opt/ppt/bin/printf line 16.>

=head1 SEE ALSO

printf(3), L<perlfunc/sprintf>
