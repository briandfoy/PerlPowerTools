=head1 NAME

printf - format and print data

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<printf> I<format> [ I<argument> ... ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<printf> command uses the first argument as the format that describes
how to print the remaining arguments.  Unlike the standard
printf(1) command, this one uses the Perl version.
See L<perlfunc/sprintf> for details.

=head1 RESTRICTIONS

This command should not be used in setuid programs as it does not run
untaint its argments and will trigger errors like C<Insecure dependency
in eval while running setuid at /opt/ppt/bin/printf line 16.>

=head1 SEE ALSO
