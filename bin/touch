=head1 NAME

touch - change access and modification times of files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

touch [-acm] [-r file] [-t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]] file...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<touch> sets the access and modification timestamps of files. By default,
both the access and modification times are set to the current time.
If necessary, files will be created.

I<touch> exits successfully if and only if all timestamps could be set
successfully.

=head2 OPTIONS

I<touch> accepts the following options:

=over 4

=item -a

Set the access time of the specified files only, unless I<-m> is given as
well.

=item -c

Do not create non-existing files. No warning is generated, and it will
not influence the exit status.

=item -f

This option is ignored, and only recognized for compatibility reasons.

=item -m

Set the modification time of the specified files only, unless I<-a> is
given as well.

=item -r file

Use the access and modification time of I<file> instead of the
current time.

=item -t [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.SS]

Set the access and modification times to the specified time.
If B<YY> is present, but B<CC> is not, then B<CC> is assumed to
be 19 if B<YY> is larger than 69, and 20 otherwise. If B<YY>
is not present, the current year is assumed.

It should be noted that many systems cannot deal with timestamps
before Jan 1, 1970 or after Jan 19, 2038.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The working of I<touch> is not influenced by any environment variables.

=head1 BUGS

I<touch> uses C<Time::Local> to translate the time format to epoch
seconds

=head1 STANDARDS

This I<touch> implementation is compatible with the B<OpenBSD> implementation.

=head1 AUTHOR

The Perl implementation of I<touch> was written by Abigail, I<perlpowertools@abigail.be>.
