=head1 NAME

arithmetic - improve your arithmetic skills

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<arithmetic> [B<-o> B<+-x/>] [B<-r> I<range>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<arithmetic> prompts you with simple arithmetic exercises, and
verifies your answers. B<arithmetic> will reply with B<Right!>
if you answered correctly, and with B<What?> if you answered incorrectly.
If B<arithmetic> thinks your answer is not a number, it will
respond with B<Please type a number!> and repeat the exercise.

After 20 questions, B<arithmetic> will tell you how many exercises you
answered correctly, and how much time it took.
You can quit at any time by typing the interrupt or end-of-file character.

If you answer an exercise incorrectly, B<arithmetic> will remember the
numbers involved, and favour those over others.

=head2 OPTIONS

B<arithmetic> accepts the following options:

=over 4

=item B<-o> B<+-x/>

By default, B<arithmetic> only asks addition exercises. By giving the
B<-o> option, B<arithmetic> will randomly choose from the given I<operators>.
If an operator is given multiple times, that operator will be picked
more often. The more it is repeated, the more it will be picked.

=item B<-r> I<range>

For I<addition> and I<multiplication>, B<arithmetic> will pick both
I<operands> in the range from 0 to I<range>, inclusively. For
I<subtraction> and I<division>, both the answer, and the right I<operand>
will be in this range. The default range is B<10>.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The working of B<arithmetic> is not influenced by any environment variables.

=head1 BUGS

None known.
