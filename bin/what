=head1 NAME

what - extract version information from a file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

what [ C<-s> ] filename ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

what searches each filename for occurrences of the pattern
B<@>(#) that the SCCS get command substitutes for the %Z% ID
keyword, and prints what follows up to a ", >, NEWLINE,
\, or null character. What can be used on any type of file,
NOT just SCCS files. Just put the magic 4 character B<@>(#)
pattern in your file and you are set.

=head2 OPTIONS

B<->B<s> Stop after the first occurrence of the pattern.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

The what utility exits with status of 0 if any version information was found,
or with a status of 1 otherwise.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The working of B<what> is not influenced by any environment variables.

=head1 EXAMPLES

If a Perl program test1.pl contains:

  my $REV = '@(# ) $Revision: 1.3 ...

and a C program test2.c contains:

  char rcsid[] = "@(# ) $Revision: 1.15 ....

and the C program is compiled to a.out...

The command:

prompt%> what test1.pl test2.c a.out

produces:

B<test1.pl:>
        B<$Revision>B<: 1.3 $';>

B<test2.c:>
        B<$Revision>B<: 1.15 $";>

B<a.out;>
        B<$Revision>B<: 1.15 $>

=head1 BUGS

B<what> has no known bugs.
