=head1 NAME

time - times the execution of a command

=head1 SYNOPSIS

time command [argument ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<time> command prints to standard error the elapsed time during
the execution of a command, the time spent in the system, and the time
spent in execution of the command.

=head1 BUGS

B<time> has a resolution of seconds for real elapsed time.  The accuracy
of B<time> is suspect, especially for small time measurements.  Some
implementations return 126 if command is found but cannot be
invoked.

=head1 EXIT STATUS

If the command is successfully invoked then B<time> returns
the exit status of the command.  Otherwise it returns 127.
