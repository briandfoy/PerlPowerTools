=head1 NAME

apply - Run a command many times with different arguments

=head1 SYNOPSIS

apply [-aB<c>] [-d] [-#] command argument [argument ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<apply> runs the given command multiple times, with different arguments.
Without arguments, I<command> is run once for each argument. If the
command contains strings of the form B<%d+>, the d'th next unused argument
will be substituted.

=head2 OPTIONS

I<apply> accepts the following options:

=over 4

=item -aB<c>

Use the character B<c> instead of B<%> for interpolation of arguments.

=item -d

Print each constructed command but do not execute it.

=item -#

If an option of the form I<-#> is given, with I<#> a number, I<apply>
uses that many arguments for each call of I<command>. If I<-0> is given
as an option, I<command> is called without arguments, and it is called
as many times as there are arguments following I<command> on the command
line.

This option is ignored if I<command> has magic B<%d+> sequences.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The working of I<apply> is not influenced by any environment variables.

=head1 CAVEATS

When I<command> has magic B<%d+> sequences, the string after interpolation
of the arguments is handed to a shell for interpretation of meta characters.
This shell is determined by Perl, during its building phase, and is typically
C</bin/sh -c> on Unix platforms.

=head1 BUGS

I<apply> does not honor the users C<$SHELL> environment variable.
