=head1 NAME

moo - play a game of MOO

=head1 SYNOPSIS

moo [size]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<moo> is a game where the user has to guess a number choosen by
the computer. By default, the computer takes a number of four digits
(including 0's), but that can be changed by giving I<moo> the number of
digits to take.  After each guess, the number of B<bull>s and B<cow>s
is displayed.  A B<bull> is a correctly guessed digit, in the right
place, while a B<cow> is a correct digit, not in the right place. Once
a game has finished because all the digits have been guessed correctly,
a new game will be started. Exiting the program can be done by typing
'q' or 'Q' on a guess, or hitting the interrupt key (usually control-C).

=head2 OPTIONS

The only option I<moo> takes is optional, and is the number of digits to
use for the number to guess.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The working of I<moo> is not influenced by any environment variables.

=head1 BUGS

I<moo> does not have any known bugs.

=head1 AUTHOR

The Perl implementation of I<moo> was written by Abigail, I<perlpowertools@abigail.be>.
