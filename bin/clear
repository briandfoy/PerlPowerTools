=head1 NAME

clear - clear the screen

=head1 SYNOPSIS

clear

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 2

Look in the termcap database, find the character to clear the screen,
and emit it.

This is a direct lift from Section 15.7, B<Ringing the Terminal Bell>, from
I<Perl Cookbook>, with C<cl> substituted for C<vb>.

=back

=head1 TYPIST

Jeffrey S. Haemer

=head1 BUGS

B<clear> should probably take an argument, like B<yes>, that will
let users send arbitrary termcap sequences, with C<cl> as the default.

=head1 SEE ALSO

  Term::Cap(3)
